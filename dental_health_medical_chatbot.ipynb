Because of this, there \\nmight not be enough saliva to keep your mouth wet. There \\nare several reasons why these glands (called salivary glands) \\nmight not work right.\\n ● Side effects of some medicines. More than 400 \\nmedicines can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva. \\nFor example, medicines for high blood pressure  \\nand depression often cause dry mouth.\\n ● Disease. Some diseases affect the salivary glands. For \\nexample, Sjögren’s syndrome, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and \\nHepatitis C can all cause dry mouth.\\n ● Radiation therapy. The salivary glands can be damaged if \\nthey are exposed to radiation during cancer treatment.\\n ● Chemotherapy. Drugs used to treat cancer can cause \\nswelling and damage in the salivary glands and cause the \\nglands to make less saliva or make saliva thicker.
